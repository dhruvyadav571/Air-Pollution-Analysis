# Analysis of air pollution trends in European capital cities

  Analysing and interpreting air pollution trends and mean annual concentrations of three pollutants- PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 in European capital cities during the period 2017–2021

  Data source: WHO Ambient Air Quality Database (V6.1) - 2024

## Tools used 
   
   Python, MySQL, Tableau and Github

## Reasons due to which the project is useful
   1. Air pollution remains to be a major health risk in many capitals of European countries.
   2. Helps in understading the air pollution in cities during a specific period of time.
   3. Uses data from credible institution: WHO.
   4. Made through data analysis tools & techniques giving unbiased and accurate insights.

## Key questions

   1. What type of pollution trends are observed in European capital cities during 2017-21?
   2. Which cities show progress between the initial and final year?
   3. Which cities consistently show pollution levels above WHO guidelines for all three pollutants in each year during 2017–2021?
   4. Which cities showed pollution levels below WHO guidelines for PM2.5 and PM10?
   5. What are trends and pollutant concentrations in Northern and Western Europe?

## Data Notes & Limitations

   1. Analysis includes capitals of countries in European Region as per WHO Database. Most countries are included but not all of them.
   2. Results are based on the available WHO data for different cities and years.
   3. Analysis is done with 75% temporal coverage for all three pollutants.
   4. Results are used for analysing trends, pollutant concentration and regions. They are not used for comparing countries and ranking the cities.
